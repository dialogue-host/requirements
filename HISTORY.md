# History of Dialogue

When I was 6, I was drawing cars. They where tuning cars with flames on the sides and gigantic wheels that would be impossible to fit under its bodywork. I was telling my parents that I wanted to become an inventor and create a car that did not need to go to the gas pump thanks to photovoltaic cells on its roof and little wind turbines behind its grille. I believed such a car could free people's time so that they could take care of one an other.

I had the chance to grow up in a caring family where problems where always solved by talking trough them. This was in stark contrast with what I saw at school and on television. People are hurting one an other in a never ending cycle of violence fueled by greed, egoism and revenge. Of course at the time those ideas where not as clear and explicit in my mind but I was inspired by heroes like Naruto that held on to his friend Sasuke and pulled him out of the infinite cycle of revenge his family was locked into. I could also site uncle Iroh that dearly suffered form his mistakes but grew out of them to become a wise and caring men. Or even Edward and Alphonse Elric that had to accept the impossibility of bringing their mom back to life and to face the greed of father.

So as I was dreaming of building these fancy cars, deeply what I wanted was to make the world a better place. But as I understood this I was left with three big questions: What is the world? What does "better" mean? And how can I do that?

## What is the world and what am I?

I went to church pretty much every Sunday up to 14 year's old. My faith had ups and downs but overall I was a strong believer. I went through multiple deep transcendental experiences that convinced me I was part of something greater than myself. But there where two gigantic issues, the first one being : If God created the universe, who or what created him?

The universe is made up of things which interact with one an other in various ways.

Something that does not interact with anything in that universe simply does not exist as it cannot be detected in any way from within the universe.

The reasoning I had is a bit metaphysical so bear with me. I took the problem by the other end and asked : What is a thing that exists? I can say that I exist and all things that I can interact with directly or indirectly also exist. Anything that does not have any link with what I am now may as well not exist to me. So the universe can be seen as a graph connecting things by cause and effect.

This logic builds up an ensemble of things that exist for me as they have a cause and effect chain leading to what I am now. There is also an other set of things for which I exist as there is a chain of cause and effects going from me to those things.

existing things that have causal links with one an other.

The issue with the concept of perfection.

## What does "better" mean?

The second gigantic hole in my faith was punched by the following question : How could people that have faith in a good forgiving selfless God go on crusades and kill tens of thousands of people simply because they had different beliefs?

The year of my 14th birthday at school we got a homework where we had to write an advert for a product that we invented based on a picture. I excelled at that exercise, it was so interesting to unveil the principles of marketing. The techniques by which one can attach a product to someone's identity and beliefs and pretend it would fulfill their deepest needs and wants. "Buy my shit and you'll find love, you'll be pretty, you'll save the planet, etc."

After doing that exercise, whenever I sat in church, I could not stop asking myself : What is the priest selling to me? He's literally promising eternal life for the ones that will follow the word of God. But in fact, he is the embodiment of that God. The priest is asking me to give him my unquestionable faith and to trust that he only wants good for me and others. As soon as people truly believe this, it becomes an incredible weapon of power able of convince them to commit any atrocities in the name of God.

No what is good and evil cannot be decided by anyone else. We have to decide it for ourselves in full awareness.

## How can we make the world a better place?

-- dialectics


Greed comes from deep insecurities and emotional voids that can create insatiable wants ; egoism comes from scarcity, when there won't be enough for everyone, but can also come from the fear that one's mistakes might undermine their worth ; and revenge comes from an unmet need for justice. Each of these are completely avoidable especially in a time of abundance such as ours.
